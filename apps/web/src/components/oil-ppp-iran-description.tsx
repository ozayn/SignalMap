      Purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusts for differences in price levels across countries,
      expressing values in terms of domestic purchasing power rather than market exchange rates.
      This series is a burden proxy—it estimates the domestic economic weight of oil prices in
      Iran—and is not a market price. Data are annual only.
